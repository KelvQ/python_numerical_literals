## Tasks Completed
**Adam Dirickson:** Programming for decimal, octal, hexadecimal, and floating point literals. Error checking.  
**Kelvin Quizon:** Creating JPGs and JFFs for decimal, octal, hexadecimal, and floating point NFAs. Error checking and assisting with programming floating point literals.  
**Tan Nguyen:** Programming for decimal, octal, and hexadecimal literals. Error checking and assisting with programming floating point literals.  

## Features
- Can recognize python decimal, octal, hexadecimal, and floating point literals.
- Tests each input through a simulated NFA made specifically for each type.
- Indicates if the input is invalid either through not matching requirements for specific integer types or by not ending on an accept state in the NFA.
- Indicates if the input is valid by matching requirements for the integer type and ending on an accept state in the NFA.
- Avoids running inputs that are not in decimal, octal, hexadecimal, or floating point.
